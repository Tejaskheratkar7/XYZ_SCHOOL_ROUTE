# XYZ School Bus Route System 🚍

## 📌 Project Overview
The **XYZ School Bus Route System** is a Java-based console application designed to determine the **shortest and most efficient route** from a student's home to school using predefined bus stops.

The project uses **graph data structures** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to calculate the optimal route and total distance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify the nearest bus stop from a student’s home
- Calculate the shortest route to school
- Apply graph algorithms in a real-world scenario
- Strengthen understanding of Dijkstra’s Algorithm

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Data Structures (Graph, Priority Queue)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ How the System Works
1. User enters distance from home to school
2. System finds the nearest bus stop
3. A weighted graph is created
4. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is applied
5. Shortest route and total distance are displayed
